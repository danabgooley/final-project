GENERAL

I have a really cool fadeout thing for my splash page, and it works! I just need to get my dimensions right :/

-----------------------------------------------

MENU SECTION

For the menu, I am using the hide/show function to make expandable sections instead of displaying it all at once
	
	+ Small Plates
	+ Breakfast
	+ etc. 

When you click on them, they expand to show that section of the menu
BUT mine only shows the most recent menu section when clicked on, and I can't get it to stay open.
